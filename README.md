## Face-recognition

### I was recently in India, well before corona to attend a wedding. As you might imagine, it was a grand wedding with many events. A week after it was over, we were bombarded with all the photos. To be honest, I was interested in the photos in which I was there. So I had to manually go through all of them and save the ones in which I was there. This is when I thought, would be cool to put all images in the system and it would just throw out the ones I want. We are trying to achieve something around this.
